* Discussed correlation output:
	- Look for literature on problem of dimentionality in ML
* Steve to relook into the AUC of LDA model
* Steve to look for some cutting edge questions in ML and cancer by reviewing some literature
 - Possibly pick Kourou and say something about the paper
* Steve to consider image processing as one of the option in Cancer research
 - Jonathan will contact a friend who has done some work on image processing
* Steve to decide whether he can spend some time writing reviews of some papers on cancer
* If possible, Steve to send email to Jonathan on the progress every monday before next meeting.

We think about an _analysis_ step and a _threshold_ step, and we
should separate these conceptually. Some of the metrics (sensitivity,
specificity) evaluate _after_ the threshold step, and some evaluate
before (AUC). The former are more general.

Some metrics don't even make sense by themselves (for example, we
should never report sensitivity without specificity (or vice versa))

The report in general has too much information. This is possibly
because we don't understand yet which pieces are more important. So we
should understand better, and present less information but more
clearly.

Details:
* what is meant by 100% of the between-group variance?
* what is the cool correlation matrix picture actually showing?
* can we identify a small number of "good" metrics that are not
sensitive to threshold?
* AUC; matching sensitivity with specificity (what is that one
called?); suggest one or two others?
* maybe show boxplot with sens/spec statistic
* clear explanation of boxplot

Resampling methods are good; make sure we can explain these concisely

Future:
* Dashboard style presentation to make it clearer for others

JD: investigate about a relocation advance

* Remake the probability density plot, but code (non-redundantly) by _observed_ diagnosis 

* Keep working on understanding of algorithms, and particularly parameters (what is tuned and why, what is not tuned and why, what are the defaults or hyper-defaults (default ranges for tuned parameters))

* Better colors (color brewer)
